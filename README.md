# Obtaining-Maps-of-the-Apparent-Diffusion-Coefficient-and-Apparent-Kurtosis-in-Human-Brain
The present functions were developed in MATLAB R2017b (The MathWorks, Inc) as part of my special undergraduate Thesis work to qualify for the Bachelor Degree in Physics  (https://bit.ly/2EWzYsI). In this Thesis work were obtained the maps for the apparent diffusion coefficient and apparent kurtosis of the brain of a healthy person (https://bit.ly/2Z9bLXR). Afterwards, a segmentation was carried out in the three types of tissue of interest for this specific study (gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid) in order to classify the values of apparent diffusion coefficient and apparent kurtosis obtained in the maps, within the three types of tissues studied.
